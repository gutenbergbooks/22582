        Oh! on this green and mossy seat,
          In my hours of sweet retreat;
        Thus I would my soul employ,
          With sense of gratitude and joy.

[Illustration]

        Farewell! farewell! the trumpet calls,
          The banner waves in view;
        And I must bid these friendly halls,
          One long! one last adieu!

[Illustration]

        The dappled herd of grazing deer,
          That seek the shades by day;
        Now started from their path with fear,
          To give the stranger way.

[Illustration]

        This is the valiant Cornish man,
          Who slew the giant Cormoran;
        A horrid savage monster, who,
          Before he kill'd, would torture you.

[Illustration]

        Why should we say 'tis yet too soon,
          To seek for Heaven or think of death;
        A flower may fade before 'tis noon,
          And we this day may lose our breath.

[Illustration]

        Ah! who is this totters along,
          And leans on the top of his stick;
        His wrinkles are many and long,
          And his beard is grown silver and thick.

[Illustration]

        I envy not thy ill-got riches,
          Sure oft remorse thy conscience twitches;
        I'd rather be yon little mouse,
          And seek my bread from house to house.

[Illustration]

        Come, Goody Dobbs, with me I pray,
          'Tis only down a little way;
        And I will give you bread and meat,
          As much as ever you can eat.

[Illustration]

        When we devote our youth to God,
          'Tis pleasing in his eyes;
        A flower, when offered in the bud,
          Is no vain sacrifice.

[Illustration]

        Charles Polish so attentive grew,
          So civil and polite;
        That all admir'd and lov'd him too,
          For all he did was right.

[Illustration]

        Upon a mountain's grassy side,
          Where firs and cedars grew;
        Young Sylvia wandered with her flocks,
          And many a hardship knew.

[Illustration]

        Hold Monster, hold! forbear, forbear!
          Thou shalt not take her life;
        To me she is a sister dear,
          To this brave man a wife.

[Illustration]

        I heard a noise of men and boys,
          The watchman's rattle too;
        And fire they cry; and then cry'd I,
          Oh dear! what shall I do.

[Illustration]

        Unhappy youth! what hast thou done,
          Why urge thy steed so fast?
        Alas! I hear him scream and groan;
          Ah me! he breathes his last.

[Illustration]

        Here Cinderella you may see,
          Weeping o'er her destiny;
        Her sisters to the Ball are gone,
          And she is left to toil alone.

[Illustration]

        The laughing harvest folks, at John,
          Stood quizzing him askew,
        'Twas John's red face that set them on,
          And then they leer'd at Sue.

[Illustration]

        Why should a weak and vain desire,
          For outward show, and gay attire,
        Engage your thoughts, employ your time,
          And waste the precious hours of prime?

[Illustration]

        All praise to him who made the sun,
          The World by day to light;
        Who gave the gentle moon to cheer,
          The still and gloomy night.

[Illustration]

        Alone beneath the gloom of night,
          Monimia went to mourn;
        She left her parents' fost'ring arms,
          Ah! never to return.

[Illustration]

        Julia had a little bird,
          With feathers bright and yellow;
        And slender legs: upon my word,
          He was a pretty fellow.

[Illustration]

        Oh! stay you cruel gipsey!
          Nor steal this darling boy,
        From his distracted parents,
          He is their only joy.

[Illustration]

        Oft Ellen would go to a very deep well,
          To look at the water below;
        How naughty! to go to a dangerous well,
          When her mother forbade her to go.

[Illustration]

        Oh! pray forbear you cruel man!
          To beat poor donkey so;
        I'll give you this sweet pretty fan,
          If you will let him go.

[Illustration]

        Poor donkey, I'll give him a handfull of grass,
          I'm sure he's a good-natured honest old ass;
        He trots to the market, to carry the sack,
          And lets me ride all the way on his back.

[Illustration]

        Here's old Toby Philpot,
          As hearty a soul,
        As e'er quaff'd a pipe,
          Or partook of a bowl.

[Illustration]

        The Sportsman here at early morn,
          With dog and gun is seen;
        The Huntsman sounds his mellow horn;
          All nature looks serene.

[Illustration]

        The dying parent, like a wailing breeze,
          Moans in the fev'rish grasp of pale disease;
        While sad and watching, with a sleepless eye,
          Her lovely daughter sits and muses by.

[Illustration]

        The forked flash that now descends,
          And thunders too that roll;
        Alike are guided by God's arm,
          And under his control.

[Illustration]

        These little girls, though very young,
          Will never do what's rude or wrong;
        When spoken to, they always try,
          To give the most polite reply.

[Illustration]

        Of Blue Beard 'tis in stories said,
          He married many wives;
        And that when they too curious grew,
          He soon cut short their lives.

[Illustration]

        I think I should like to be happy to-day
          If I could but tell the easiest way;
        But then I don't know any pretty new play,
          Unless it's a romp with my little dog Tray.

[Illustration]

        At length before his wide stretch'd eyes,
          St. Paul's proud dome arose;
        That is, said Ralph in great surprize
          The KING I do suppose!!

[Illustration]

        A tale should be judicious, clear, succinct,
          The language plain, and incidents well link'd;
        Tell not as new, what every body knows,
          And new or old, still hasten to a close.

[Illustration]

        And so you do not like to spell,
          Ellen my dear; oh very well,
        'Tis dull and troublesome you say,
          And you would rather be at play.

[Illustration]

        An Annual custom here was held,
          For all the Corporation,
        To hear the boy that most excell'd,
          Deliver an oration.

[Illustration]

        Alas! and is domestic strife,
          That sorest ill of human life,
        A plague so little to be feared,
          As to be wantonly incurr'd?

[Illustration]

        My numbers this day she had sung,
          And gave them a grace so divine,
        As only her musical tongue,
          Could infuse into numbers of mine.

[Illustration]

        Here we see a common game,
          Of which most boys are fond;
        Some hit the ring with nicest aim,
          While others go beyond.

[Illustration]

        Little sister come away,
          And in the garden let us play;
        But do not pluck the pretty flowers,
          Because you know they are not ours.

[Illustration]

        A boat, which oft had stem'd the tide,
          Was by the shore close moored;
        In which Maria fain would ride,
          And therefore went on board.

[Illustration]

        Good God! how abject is our race,
          Condemn'd to slavery and disgrace;
        Shall we our servitude retain,
          Because our sires have borne the chain?

[Illustration]

        Go; thou art all unfit to share,
          The pleasures of this place;
        With such as its old Tenants are,
          Creatures of gentle race.

[Illustration]

        In Westminster Abbey lie in grand state,
          The bones of Kings and Noblemen great,
        Whose figures in wax and marble are shown,
          With Generals and Admirals carv'd in stone.

[Illustration]

        Her heart beat strong; she gave a bound,
          Down came the milk-pail on the ground,
        Eggs, fowls, pig, hog, (ah! well-a-day,)
          Cow, calf, and farm, all swam away.

[Illustration]

        Why is this silly girl so vain?
          Looking in the glass again;
        For the meekest flower of Spring,
          Is a gayer little thing.

[Illustration]

        I little thought that thus forlorn,
          In deserts I should bide;
        And have not where to lay my head,
          Amid the World so wide.

[Illustration]

        Dear lady, she cries, and tears trickle down,
          Relieve a poor beggar, I pray;
        I've wander'd all hungry about the wide town,
          And have not eat a morsel to-day.

[Illustration]

        Ah! there it falls, and now 'tis dead,
          Poor harmless little thing;
        The shot went through its pretty head,
          And broke its little wing.

[Illustration]

        He looks of a strong hardy race,
          And his bonnet and jacket of plaid;
        With shrewdness and sense in his face,
          Proclaim him a true scottish lad.

[Illustration]

        Oh! say what stranger cause yet unexplor'd,
          Could make a gentle belle reject a lord;
        In tasks so bold, can little men engage,
          And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty rage.

[Illustration]

        I've fought at Egypt, Italy,
          Marengo, Waterloo;
        And now I'm helpless, left to die,
          In misery, want, and woe.

[Illustration]

        Mamma shall we visit Miss Ellen to-day,
          And sweet little Julia and Ann;
        The morning's so fine, the sun is so bright,
          Do go dear mamma if you can.

[Illustration]

        Old Susan in her cottage small,
          Tho' low the roof and mud the wall,
        Enjoys within her peaceful shed,
          Her wholesome crust of barley-bread.

[Illustration]

        Great God! with wonder and with praise,
          On all thy works I look;
        But still thy wisdom, power, and grace,
          Shines brightest in thy Book.

[Illustration]

        These harmless sports we like to see,
          No mischief here appears;
        Young Alfred shews activity,
          Well suited to his years.

[Illustration]

        Run William to the baker's man,
          And quick to him apply;
        I know he'll give you, if he can,
          A smoking hot mince-pie.

[Illustration]

        Ah! poor little Red Riding Hood,
          You never once dreamt,
        When you met the Wolf in the wood,
          Of his cruel intent.

[Illustration]

        Oh! ask me not to be your bride,
          Oh! do not call me fair;
        For I have thrown the wreath aside,
          I once was proud to wear.

[Illustration]

        Away went Gilpin neck or nought;
          Away went hat and wig;
        He little dreamt when he set out,
          Of running such a rig.

[Illustration]

        Old Cherry and Blossom are having a fight,
          Do let us get out of their way;
        And not stop to witness so shocking a sight,
          Oh dear what a terrible fray!

[Illustration]

        Dancing on the village green,
          The pretty English girl is seen;
        Or beside the cottage neat,
          Knitting on the garden seat.

[Illustration]

        Some strength of arm and steady eye,
          This ancient game demands;
        To make the arrow distant fly,
          Is not for feeble hands.

[Illustration]

        Whoever played at blind-man's buff,
          And was the first to cry 'enough;'
        When nearly caught, who did not quake,
          Or laugh to see poor Buff's mistake?

[Illustration]

        When storms of passion rude arise,
          Be Nature's rule before your eyes;
        May friendship henceforth both unite,
          May both in future act aright.

[Illustration]

        With glowing cheeks the skaiter meets,
          The keen and frosty air;
        Performs variety of feats,
          To shew what skaiters dare.

[Illustration]

        Have you forgot Kate, prithee say,
          How many seasons here we've tarried;
        'Tis FORTY years this very day,
          Since you and I, old girl, were married.

[Illustration]

        Two horses used to bit and bridle,
          But always much disposed to idle,
        Agreed, as soon as they were able,
          To steal unnoticed from the stable.

[Illustration]

        Thank you pretty cow that made,
          Pleasant milk to soak my bread,
        Every day and every night,
          Warm and fresh, and sweet and white.
